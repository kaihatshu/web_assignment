        <h2> The experience that I got through </h2>
       <p>When learning Html and Css for the first time  it was exciting,  interesting at the same time automatically or naturally and we all know that most of the teenagers are interested in it because of it's colorful  designs and user interface that today's Time provide and also it is easy to learn at first than  programming languages like Python,java etc.
        <br> 
        But how easy? In the begining  when learning phase  to see the simple code of our own  being execute gave  a feeling of Achivement - a reward feeling which must be the thing that keeps us engaged in html maybe,
         but when going through codes if  you know the codes? what it does? than it is simple that means  you have invested in good learning practice.
         <br> But when you don't know than it can be really hard but !!THANK GOD!! We had our web Tutor  who taught us what is what.

         Still I got proplems while making this portfolio website because it was my First Time and our course was not that far.
         W3schools was really helpful when finding all the Html and Css code after our web tutor, it  not only guide us in simple language but also demonstrated what the code does - So Thanks to it.
         And lastly the Youtubers like <b>Simple dev</b>  were really simple in his teaching style. He taught from basics but in depth which was really helpful.



         <h2>The inspiration of my website designs and colors </h2>
         <p> When selecting   a color or any kind of image before implementing it to the website was really confusing and hard.<br>

             The layout styles were inspired by Gopro website and still you can see the top panel exist among others which got changed or deleted.
            There is nothing in the top panel but still I happen to like it. </p>
            <img class="screen2" src="./images/top-panel.png" alt="The screen shot "/>     

             <p>The colors like in the nav when you hover  is a depiction of fire when a rocket is launched.
                Same like that there is a satellite image in the head behind the nav tag  </p>
             <p>My website is space-rocket based type website right now but it was not at first place 
                <br>
                I was totally trying to make it user interractive where user will never fill bore but it came completely opposite of what I thought.
                 Animation is not complete in  any where and there are things missing too.
                
                 <p>When coming till end I was in    thinking  that "yeah this is my first time and whatever happens to this I will just submit it and  try my    best next time " </p>
                
                 <p> there are some screenshot that I can relate to you people.</p>

                    <img class="screen" src="./images/Screenshot.png" alt="The screen shot "/>
               
                   <p>  This image is when it looked at near starting The color is rocket jet fire in the nav.</p> 

                     <p> And one VS code screenshot that was taken at the middle of the term 
<img class="screen"src="./images/Screenshot 2023-03-15 210823.png" alt="The screen shot "/>
And Yeah thats it. </p>
