       <p>When learning Html and Css for the first time  it was exciting,  interesting at the same time automatically or naturally and we all know that most of the teenagers are interested in it because of it's colorful  designs and user interface that today's Time provide and also it is easy to learn at first than  programming languages like Python,java etc.
        <br> 
        But how easy? In the begining  when learning phase  to see the simple code of our own  being execute gave  a feeling of Achivement - a reward feeling which must be the thing that keeps us engaged in html maybe,
         but when going through codes if  you know the codes? what it does? than it is simple that means  you have invested in good learning practice.
         <br> But when you don't know than it can be really hard but !!THANK GOD!! We had our web Tutor  who taught us what is what.

         Still I got proplems while making this portfolio website because it was my First Time and our course was not that far.
         W3schools was really helpful when finding all the Html and Css code after our web tutor, it  not only guide us in simple language but also demonstrated what the code do - So Thanks to it.
        not easy task, cause we had to remember so much of command even to remember </p>
