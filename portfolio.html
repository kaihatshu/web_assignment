        <p>  If you are wondering about my skills to know than yeah I have got some skills that may or may not help you
            but it will help me alot when working like :- soldering. This skill I got from practicing on my electronical 
            projects that I have been involved in my High School with my friends, we took part in science projects that 
            helped me build this skill.
           Other one is Building Electrician and I have got it's certificate too. During the lockdown period I got enrolled 
           in a CTEVT course for short period of level 1 
           And the other is if somebody needs  a Archery trainer than I can be atleast a asistant  to them. Guide them whatever I have been
           taught by my coach.
